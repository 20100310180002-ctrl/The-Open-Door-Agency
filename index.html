            <p>The Open Door Agency is a Social Enterprise and Strategic Human Capital Consultancy based in Bhutan. We act as the vital link between the "hidden" talent pool of neurodivergent and differently-abled individuals and the evolving private and public sectors of our nation.</p>
            <p>We are not a recruitment firm that merely "fills slots." We are workplace architects. We redefine "productivity" by proving that inclusivity is a competitive business advantage. In the context of Bhutan, we are a GNH-driven agency, dedicated to the pillar of "Sustainable and Equitable Socio-Economic Development."</p>
            <p>Currently, Bhutan faces a "Talent Paradox." While our nation is modernizing rapidly toward a digital and mindful economy, a significant portion of our population remains economically invisible. Many modern offices in Thimphu are designed for a "neurotypical" standard, creating "invisible walls" for brilliant minds with Autism or ADHD.</p>
            <p>Our Perspective: At The Open Door Agency, we operate under a radical but simple philosophy: Disability is not a person’s deficit; it is a design failure of the environment. Diff-ability, not Disability: We see neurodivergence as a natural variation in the human genome. The "Curb-Cut" Effect: When you make a workspace better for a neurodivergent person, you make it better for everyone.</p>
